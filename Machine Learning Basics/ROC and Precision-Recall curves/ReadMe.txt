ROC curve is plotted using different thresholds to calcualte the TPR. A change in the threshold would result in a change in the TPR which is used as our points for the ROC curve. 

The ideal ROC curve is one that shoots up immediately towards the top left side of the graph and maintains a 100% TPR for each TPR.
