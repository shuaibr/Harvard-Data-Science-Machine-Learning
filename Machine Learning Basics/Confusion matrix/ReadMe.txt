The confusion matrix is an important tool for categorical features to understand how well a model is performing using sensitivity and model specificity. 

Sensitivity is the true positive rate, also known as the recall rate. This is the number of positive outcomes correctly identified. 

Specificity = TN/(FN+TN) is the true negative rate, also known as precision. This is the negative outcomes correctly identified. 

Our confusion matrix is:
         actual
predicted Female Male
   Female     49   27
   Male       70  379

Here we can see that proportion of males predicted correctly is much higher than the number of females predicted correctly. In fact, Males had an accuracy of 93.3% while the accuracy for Females was 41.2%. Since the dataset is overwhelingly male (73% male!), the model can get away with setting a low threshold since it's likely that most males are taller than 64 inches. This means that there is a heavy male bias. 

Therefore when we look at our confusion matrix and statistics:
          Reference
Prediction Female Male
    Female     49   27
    Male       70  379
                                          
               Accuracy : 0.8152          
                 95% CI : (0.7793, 0.8475)
    No Information Rate : 0.7733          
    P-Value [Acc > NIR] : 0.0112          
                                          
                  Kappa : 0.3958          
                                          
 Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 2.004e-05       
                                          
            Sensitivity : 0.41176         
            Specificity : 0.93350         
         Pos Pred Value : 0.64474         
         Neg Pred Value : 0.84410         
             Prevalence : 0.22667         
         Detection Rate : 0.09333         
   Detection Prevalence : 0.14476         
      Balanced Accuracy : 0.67263         
                                          
       'Positive' Class : Female   

We can see that this model that a high TPR (Specificity) but a low TNR (Sensitivity). Since the prevalence of females is low, the model does not mind incorrectly labelling females as males because it has a lower impact on accuracy.
